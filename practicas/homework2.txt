1. Wireframes/ mockups of my project for 1 min 4 sections-for 2 min 8
2. Get 3 boostrap VSC plugins/ get 3 python VSC plugins

Boostrap:

1-HTML CSS Support -provides intellisense in your HTML files based on the CSS that is included in your project or referenced remotely.
2-Autoprefixer -Autoprefixer will automatically add vendor prefixes to make sure your app looks as good as possible in different browsers.
3-Bootstrap 4, Font awesome 4, Font Awesome 5 Free & Pro snippets-Thatâ€™s why I figured it was worth sharing this extension which provides intellisense for Bootstrap 4, Font Awesome 4, and Font Awesome 5.

Python:

1-Python Docstring Generator
2-Trailing Spaces
3-Gitlens
